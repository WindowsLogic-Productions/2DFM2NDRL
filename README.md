# wanwan

rollback launcher for fighter maker games (fm2k/fm95). fm95 support not finished
yet. spawns the game and injects a hook dll that does the save-state rollback,
online play, spectating and replays. windows 32-bit only, cross-compiled from
wsl/linux with mingw-w64 (i686) -- injection + the 32-bit game abi are why.
native linux isn't wired up.

## build

need wsl2 or linux with the i686 mingw toolchain:

    sudo apt install -y gcc-mingw-w64-i686 g++-mingw-w64-i686 binutils-mingw-w64-i686 cmake ninja-build git

then:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/Armonte/wanwan.git
    cd wanwan
    ./make_build.sh    # inits submodules + runs cmake
    ./build.sh         # compiles, stripped binaries land in dist/

forgot --recursive? make_build.sh self-heals it. gekkonet and the one kgt parity
header are vendored in-tree as plain files so they need no submodule step.
SDL, SDL_image, imgui, minhook and miniupnp are submodules make_build.sh pulls
for you (and only the jpeg/png/tiff image codecs, not the big unused
avif/jxl/webp ones).

outputs land in dist/: FM2K_RollbackLauncher.exe, FM2KHook.dll, FM95Hook.dll,
FM2KUpdater.exe. unstripped copies with full debug info stay in build/ for
symbolication. build/ is incremental, don't nuke it between builds.

## run

drop the launcher + both hook dlls in a folder, point it at your fm2k games, go.
both dlls ship together so it picks the right one per engine (fm2k vs fm95/cpw).
deeper notes in docs/.

## deploy (maintainer only)

go.sh builds then copies into my local windows games tree (/mnt/c/games). that
half skips itself on any machine without that tree, so go.sh just builds for
everyone else. the normal flow is make_build.sh && build.sh.

source-available, NOT open source. the launcher + hooks (my own code) are under
the PolyForm Noncommercial License 1.0.0 with a revocation addendum -- see
[LICENSE](LICENSE). short version: personal/noncommercial use, modification and
noncommercial redistribution are fine; commercial use needs a separate license;
the grant is revocable. bundled third-party components keep their own (permissive)
licenses -- see [THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md](THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md). the native
frontend uses Slint under its royalty-free license.
