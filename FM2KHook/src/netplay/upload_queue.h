// upload_queue — drop a manifest JSON into <game_dir>/upload_queue/ that
// the launcher uploads to the hub. Used for crash + desync diagnostic
// auto-collection.
//
// Design: hook only does fopen/fwrite/fclose. No threading, no network,
// no allocator-sensitive work — safe to call from a desync terminate
// path or an unhandled exception filter where the process is about to
// die.
//
// The launcher polls <game_dir>/upload_queue/*.json from its main tick,
// reads each manifest, gzips referenced files, POSTs multipart to
// https://hub.2dfm.org/logs/upload with X-FM2K-Log-Secret, then moves
// processed manifests to <game_dir>/upload_queue/done/.
