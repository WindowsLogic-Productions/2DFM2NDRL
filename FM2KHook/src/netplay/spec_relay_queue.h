// Spec hub-relay shared-memory queues.
//
// When the host hook runs in relay mode (FM2K_SPEC_TRANSPORT=relay), spec
// data no longer goes out via P2P TCP. Instead the hook enqueues each
// SpecDataBinary frame into an SPSC ring buffer in shared memory; the
// launcher polls the ring once per tick and forwards each frame to the
// hub as a WebSocket binary message. Hub fans out to subscribed specs.
//
// On the spec side, the inverse: hub sends binary frames to the spec's
// WS, the spec launcher writes them into a second ring buffer in shared
// memory, and the spec hook polls and dispatches through the existing
// receive-handler path (the same handlers that today consume bytes from
// SpectatorTCP).
//
// Two rings per process:
//   Outbound: hook -> launcher (hook produces, launcher consumes)
//   Inbound:  launcher -> hook (launcher produces, hook consumes)
//
// Mappings are named per-game-PID so multiple game instances on the
// same host don't collide:
//   FM2K_SpecRelayOut_<pid>
//   FM2K_SpecRelayIn_<pid>
//
// SPSC discipline: only one producer and one consumer per ring, so no
// locking required. write_idx / read_idx are atomic 64-bit counters
// modulo capacity (capacity is a power of two for cheap masking).
//
// Wire format of Slot mirrors hub.py:SpecDataBinary (see Phase 1 commit
// 33a7890 in fm2k-hub). The launcher packs Slot fields into the over-
// the-wire format right before WS send; the hub un-packs the same way.

//
// Memory ordering:
//   Producer: fill slot fields, then store write_idx with release.
//   Consumer: load write_idx with acquire, read slot fields, then store
//             read_idx with release.
// On 32-bit Windows x86 (our target), 64-bit volatile loads/stores are

// own counter; each side reads the other's counter and may see stale
// values (consumer sees "ring less full than it really is" = safe to
// produce more; producer sees "ring more full than it really is" = safe
// drop). No torn reads across counters because they're only ever
// produced by one side.

// (For 32-bit, MSVC / GCC's std::atomic<uint64_t> falls back to
