// CSS auto-lock-and-confirm hook.
//
// For offline replay playback (FM2K_REPLAY_FILE set): the .fm2krep file
// contains battle INPUTs only (slice from MATCH_START → MATCH_END), no
// CSS-traversal inputs. Without this hook, those battle inputs leak into
// the local game's CSS state machine as cursor moves + confirm bits → game
// auto-walks CSS but lands on the wrong characters → desynced replay.
//
// This hook intercepts game_state_manager @ 0x406FC0 (FM2K) and, while
// game_mode == 2000 (CSS), pre-injects state writes that pin cursor
// positions to the chars recorded in MATCH_START's header and force a
// confirm bit each frame until both action_states lock. The natural state-1
// logic does the actual work — file loads, portrait creation, player color
// assignment — so the local game ends up with the right chars selected
// without any duplicated setup logic on our side.
//
// See docs/analysis/css_state_machine.md for the IDA pass that maps the
// state machine + critical addresses.

// previous match's locks persist), which let the spectator race into the
// next battle BEFORE the host's MATCH_START arrived -- early battle entry
// consumed the once-per-battle init edge before the deferred PIN_RNG /
// RESET_INPUT_STATE were even queued (battle-2 desync), and the screen ran

// (OnReplayMatchStart) takes precedence via the !armed gate; cleared at
