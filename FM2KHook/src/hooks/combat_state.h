// Combat-state introspection — typed accessors over the live game object /
// char_data fields we use to drive smarter training-mode behaviors. Read-only
// helpers; nothing here writes to game memory. Always safe to call (returns a
// neutral value if the underlying pointers are null / unset, e.g. pre-battle).
//
// Built from analysis of hit_detection_system (0x40f010), health_damage_-
// manager (0x40e7c0), and character_facing_controller (0x40e5c0). See
// docs/analysis/per_game_patches.md (Combat State Map section) for the full
// field layout and provenance.
//
// Used initially by the state-driven Guard mode in per_game_patches.cpp; the
// longer-term goal is to feed an ETM-style reversal/dummy system (see plan
// in conversation history) once we add edge detection on top.

// Convenience predicate: should a reactive Guard hold back this frame?
// Returns true when ANY of:
//   - P2 is currently in blockstun (continuing a string)
//   - P1 (the opponent) has an active hitbox (a hit is incoming OR landing)
// Returns false during hitstun (P2 can't act anyway), idle frames, or when
// player snapshots are invalid.
bool ShouldGuardP2();

// Compute the actual input bits P2 should produce this frame for a state-
// driven Guard. Returns 0 (no input), back direction alone (stand-block),
// or DOWN + back direction (crouch-block). FM2K layout: bit 0 = LEFT,
// bit 1 = RIGHT, bit 2 = UP, bit 3 = DOWN.
//
// Block stance is chosen per-frame from the attacker's airborne state:
//   * P1 airborne (jump-in incoming) → stand-block (back only). A crouching
//     P2 misses jumping attacks; standing puts the standing hurtbox in
//     range and the engine's stand-block path handles the block.
//   * P1 grounded → crouch-block (DOWN + back). Crouching sets char_flags
//     bit 3 at char_data+0x7CB6, which routes hit_detection_system into
//     the crouching-block path covering LOW and MID attacks.
//
// Limitation: overheads from a grounded P1 still slip through (need to
// crouch-block lows but stand-block overheads — disambiguation requires
// hit-flag decode work, deferred). Acceptable default since FM2K games
// rarely use grounded overheads.
//
// Blockstrings: the engine auto-blocks during blockstun. We only need to
// land hit #1 correctly; subsequent hits in a string block themselves.
//
// The back-direction bit is selected based on relative P1/P2 X-positions
// so Guard survives a side switch (cross-up etc). The returned screen-
// coord value goes through Hook_GetPlayerInput's facing-fix, which swaps
// LEFT/RIGHT based on char_flags so the engine ultimately sees the back-
// relative input regardless of which side P2 is on.
//
// Internally latches a `hold_frames` counter for ~12 frames after the last
// trigger so:
//   * P2 doesn't microwalk between active frames of a multi-hit move
//   * P2 keeps blocking through attack recovery so the next gatling/string
//     hit also blocks
//   * the 1-frame state-detection pipeline delay (we see P1's active
//     hitbox AFTER it landed) doesn't cost us blocks on fast moves
//
// Triggers (any one refreshes the latch):
//   1. P2 is currently in blockstun (string continuation)
//   2. P1 has an active hitbox (the strict state signal)
//   3. P1 is in any scripted action (flags_stun & 4 — startup coverage)
//   4. P1's CURRENT input has any attack button pressed (anticipates the
//      hitbox by 3+ frames since button press leads active frames; this
//      is what makes the Guard actually fast enough on jab-speed attacks)
//
// `p1_input_screen_coord` is the 11-bit screen-coordinate input value
// sampled from P1's bindings before the facing-fix — same value passed to
// PerGamePatches_BattleInputOverride. Used for trigger #4.
