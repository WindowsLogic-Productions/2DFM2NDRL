Comment: There are no proper links to each notice and no copyright information, this does not cut in it terms of usage, but obviously the AI didn't know how to actually make third-party notices and link them to the correct license or copyright information.

# Third-Party Notices

This product (the FM2K Rollback launcher and `FM2KHook`/`FM95Hook` DLLs) bundles
and links the third-party components below. Each is the property of its
respective authors and is used under its own license -- the project's own LICENSE
(PolyForm Noncommercial + Revocation Addendum) does NOT apply to them. The full
license text for each lives in its directory under `vendored/`.

All bundled components are under permissive (non-copyleft) licenses; none impose
copyleft obligations on this project's own code.

## Slint (native frontend)

The native frontend is built with [Slint](https://slint.dev), used under the
**Slint Royalty-free Desktop, Mobile, and Web Applications License** (granted to
Armonte Williams). Slint's own copyright and license notices are retained in its
source. Attribution is provided per that license; see the project's download
page. Slint is NOT covered by this project's LICENSE.

## Notes

- `vendored/SDL/src/hidapi/LICENSE-gpl3.txt` is one option of hidapi's
  multi-license offering; SDL bundles hidapi under its permissive option, so no
  GPL terms apply to this product.
- The SDL_image AVIF/JXL/WEBP codecs (`libavif`, `libjxl`, `aom`, `dav1d`,
  `libwebp`) are NOT built or linked; their nested example/contrib licenses do
  not apply to anything in the shipped binaries.
