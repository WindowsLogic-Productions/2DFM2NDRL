// FM2K_Updater — auto-updater glue for the launcher.
//
// Pulls "LatestVersion" from raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/main,
// compares with kAppVersion (from version_local.h), and if newer
// downloads the matching release zip from
// github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/v<ver>/fm2k_v<ver>.zip.
// On user confirm, hands the zip to FM2KUpdater.exe (separate target),
// which extracts it after the launcher exits and relaunches.
//
// All HTTP via WinHTTP. Async — work runs on a background thread, the
// UI polls Snapshot() each frame and renders the pill state.
