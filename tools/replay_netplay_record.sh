# Manual real-netplay replay-determinism recorder.
#
# Spawns TWO launcher instances in loopback (real GekkoSession, no stress)
# with parity capture wired. You play the match manually:
#   1. Click through title on BOTH instances
#   2. Pick characters in CSS on BOTH (any chars, doesn't matter)
#   3. Play a round or two
#   4. Let MATCH_END fire OR close the windows
#
# After both windows close, the harness pulls the host's .fm2krep + parity
# stream and runs --replay against it. parity_diff reports any divergence.
#
# This is the FAITHFUL "real users" replay-determinism test — the stress-
# session harness (replay_selftest.py) skips real-netplay's predictive
# rollback, which is what production users actually hit.
