"""Phase 3: resolve dead outbound links to Wayback snapshots.

Most FM2K-era game homepages were on Geocities JP (closed 2019-03)
and other free-host services that have since died. The Internet
Archive has snapshots of most of them — we just need to query CDX,
filter to the pre-shutdown era, and pick the latest available.

Per-link policy:
  1. Always query the CDX index (cheap, ~100ms each).
  2. Prefer snapshots with statuscode=200 and timestamp <= 2018-12-31
     (Geocities JP shut March 2019; pages got LAST-CHANCE notices in
     late 2018, so the freshest pre-shutdown snapshot is the most
     complete article AND most likely to still be reachable in Wayback).
  3. Fall back to the latest 2xx of any era if no <=2018 snapshot exists
     (some sites lived past 2018 — newer doujin homepages, etc).
  4. Skip if zero 2xx snapshots — record as 'no_archive' so the
     downstream download phase can warn.

Output is merged into the existing per-game JSON under an "outbound"
field — each link gains an "archive" sub-record:

  "outbound": [
    {
      "url": "http://www.geocities.jp/foo/...",
      "label": "Homepage",
      "archive": {
        "wayback_url":  "https://web.archive.org/web/20181201123456/...",
        "timestamp":    "20181201123456",
        "live_status":  "dead" | "live" | "unknown",
        "preferred":    "wayback_pre2019" | "wayback_latest" | "live"
      }
    }
